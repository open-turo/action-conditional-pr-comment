# action-conditional-pr-comment
GitHub Action that supports instructing the author of a Pull Request (PR) how to resolve a given problem within the context of a PR. Conditionally adds a comment to the PR with resolution instructions, and once the condition is found to be resolved, allows the previously added comment, if one exists at that time, to be removed from the PR.
